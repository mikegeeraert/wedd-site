# Using The support Scripts:

The support scripts for the wedd-site all run inside a python virtual env.
They allow you to:
  1. Import your guests from a CSV
  2. Generate email templates to send invites to your guests 
  
## Getting Started:

1. Open a terminal, and navigate to the root for the wedd-site repo
2. Use the following command to begin using the virtual environment:
```commandline
    $ source support-scripts/bin/activate
``` 
3. Now your terminal session should be inside a python virtual environment. 
Running any support scripts will use libraries that have been installed in this isolated environment
